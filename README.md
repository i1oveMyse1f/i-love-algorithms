## How to contribute

Some useful commands:

- `bundle exec jekyll serve` - run the site locally
- Images supports width attribute, e.g.:

```txt
![upper and lower bound definition](img/upper-and-lower-bounds.svg){:width="50%"}
```

- MathJax is supported, e.g. $ f(n) = \begin{cases}
2^n, & \text{если } n < 100 \\
\log n, & \text{иначе}
\end{cases}$:

```txt
$ f(n) = \begin{cases}
2^n, & \text{если } n < 100 \\
\log n, & \text{иначе}
\end{cases}$
```
